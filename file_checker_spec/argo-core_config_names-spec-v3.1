CONFIG_BitMaskMonthsIceDetectionActive_NUMBER | This parameter indicates for which months the ice detection algorithm is active. The bit mask is input as a 3 digit hexadecimal value in the mission file sent to the float. This parameter in the metadata file however is the decimal number of that hexadecimal value. For example for the Southern Hemisphere the default position is to have the ice detection algorithm active for all months except February. (The hexadecimal value in the mission file is 'FFD' and the number for the configuration parameter in the metafile would be 4093). The northern hemisphere default would be all months active except for August. In this case the hexadecimal value is 'F7F' and the number in the configuration parameter in the metafile would be 3967).  | O | changeable | "APEX, SOLO, others.."

CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure_dbar  | "The pressure at which the CTD pump is switched off.  As the float ascends, the code looks at the pressure and if <= CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure, the CTD is turned off. CTDPumpStopPressure is a firmware threshold and as such, data may continue to be collected for a limited span after the threshold is recognized. Especially in floats that return high resolution discrete data, there might be data collected shallower than the cut off, due to the discrete nature of the pressure data and also due to the time necessary for the firmware to turn off the CTD once the pressure threshold is reached. For example for SOLOII floats the CTD is switched off at 1dbar, and typically the shallowest data is from 0.5 to 0.8 dbar. This shallow data should be carefully assessed for its validity." | O |  | "PROVOR, ARVOR, SOLO II"
CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressureOffset_dbar | "The pressure in decibars added to the most recently measured pressure at the surface, the sum of which is the pressure at which the conductivity, temperature and pressure sampling stops for a pumped type CTD.

CONFIG_CycleTime_hours | "For APEX and ARVOR floats this is the total duration of one cycle, usually 240 hours (10 days).

CONFIG_DeepProfileFirstFloat_LOGICAL | "Some APEX floats are set to do a ""profile on deployment"". This means that when the float is deployed it skips the drift phase at the PARKING depth and sinks directly to the PROFILE depth and starts ascending for the first profile. Independent of the Park and Profile cycle length, the first profile is always a Deep Profile that begins at the Profile Depth. This means the float returns a CTD profile relatively soon, typically less than a day, after the float is deployed. This feature supports comparison of the
initial float profile with a conventional CTD cast from the ship. The result is that the first cycle is of shorter duration with a profile depth equal to PROFILE configuration pressure (regardless of the CONFIG_ParkAndProfileCycleCounter_COUNT configuration information). (Yes = 1, No = 0)." | O |  | "APEX, PROVOR"

CONFIG_DescentAdjustmentToBuoyancy_seconds | "Commonly cited as 'buoyancy nudge', this controls the descent rate, units could be COUNT or whatever is reported, i.e. for SOLOII it is seconds pump is run to adjust float descent rate from drift depth to profile depth. The SOLO-II floats are ballasted for profile depth, if the floats are poorly ballasted, float will descend quite fast to profile depth. The more pumping that is done at 1000db that is unnecessary at 2000db will save energy and it can be used as an energy saving measure. Occasionally this means the float will stop short of profile depth but won't have grounded. " | O |  |

CONFIG_GPSSetClock_LOGICAL | Set the float Real Time Clock with GPS time. | O | To disable float clock set from GPS time when at surface. | PROVOR
CONFIG_GPSSetClockSensorCard_LOGICAL | "When the float Real Time Clock is set, also set the clock of the measurement card." |  | JP Comments: Don't know how to name the CTS5 electronic cards (there is one card for the float and the CTD and one for the Bio sensors). Esmee comments: JP this was labelled as GPS - is it appropriate to put GPS in front of original proposed name? | PROVOR
CONFIG_GPSTimeout_seconds | Timeout for GPS acquisition. | O |  | NOVA/DOVA
CONFIG_GroundingMode_LOGICAL | "Action performed by the float when a grounding is detected. 0: the float changes its drift pressure, 1: the float stays on the seabed until the next phase of the cycle. For PROVOR CTS5 the number assigned to each mode has changed - see float manual for details for this model." | O |  | 
CONFIG_GroundingModeDeepZoneThickness_dbar | "In case of grounding during the ""descent to profile depth"" phase, this parameter (PM18 in float user manual) defines the thickness of a new deep zone (from profile start pressure) for the purpose of data reduction.

CONFIG_GroundingModeForProfileDepth_NUMBER | "Action performed by the float when a grounding is detected during descent to profile depth. For PROVOR CTS5 floats: 2: the float stays on the seabed until the ascent start time, 3: the ascent starts immediately." | O | In this float version the actions to be performed when a grounding is detected at parking depth (stored in CONFIG_GroundingMode_NUMBER) or at profile depth (stored in CONFIG_GroundingModeForProfileDepth_NUMBER) may differ.

CONFIG_HangingMode_NUMBER | Action performed by the float when a hanging is detected (see float manual for details). [JP additional comments on behaviour for PROVOR floats: The hanging mode is the same idea as the grounding mode but for an ascent phase. When the float detects a too low vertical motion after having activated its pump to try to ascend it enters in a hanging mode (it is probably stuck at the sea floor). This parameter configures (with the same idea as CONFIG_GroundingMode_NUMBER for grounding) what should be the actions to perform to try to escape from hanging (it can activate its pump and valve alternatively to try to escape or abandon the ascent and switch to the next scheduled task]. | O |  | PROVOR
CONFIG_HydraulicDataTransmission_LOGICAL | "The float transmits hydraulic data at the end of the cycle. The float records the pump/valve actions (time, pressure, duration); these data can be transmitted (or not) in specific SBD messages through a remote control command.  Input: (Yes=1/No=0)." | O |  | ARVOR Iridium
CONFIG_HyperRetractionStopPressure_dbar | "For Apex APF11 Iridium floats, Hyper Retraction is used to pull in an amount of oil to temporarily increase a float�s density as it leaves the ocean surface. The result of the increased float density allows a float to move through a mixed density layer more easily or allows a float to descend at a faster rate. In particular, the HyperRetractPressure is the pressure that the float uses to restore the piston back to the ParkDescentCount." | O |  | APEX APF11
